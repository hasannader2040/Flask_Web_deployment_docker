# Flask Web Deployment with Docker

## Overview

**Flask Web Deployment with Docker** is a project that demonstrates how to deploy a Flask web application using Docker. The main goal of this project is to provide a containerized environment for a Flask application, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments. Docker is used to package the application along with all its dependencies, making it easier to run on any system that supports Docker.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to show how a simple Flask web application can be containerized and deployed using Docker. This approach solves common issues related to environment configuration and dependency management, allowing for smooth deployment across different platforms.

## Features

- **Containerized Flask Application**: The application runs inside a Docker container, ensuring the same environment everywhere it is deployed.
- **Easy Deployment**: With Docker, deploying the Flask application is straightforward and reproducible.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Docker containers can run on any platform that supports Docker, making the deployment process platform-independent.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Docker**: Docker should be installed and running on your machine. You can download Docker from the [official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- **Git**: Git is required to clone the repository. You can install Git from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/).

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hasannader2040/Flask_Web_deployment_docker.git
 ```




2- **Navigate to the project directory:**

 ```bash
cd Flask_Web_deployment_docker
 ```

Build the Docker image:

 ```bash
docker build -t flask-docker-app .
 ```

This command will create a Docker image named flask-docker-app based on the instructions in the Dockerfile.

Running the Application
To run the Docker container, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-docker-app
The -p 5000:5000 flag maps port 5000 inside the Docker container to port 5000 on your local machine. You can access the Flask web application by navigating to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.
Usage
Here are some examples of how to use the Flask Web Application with Docker:

Access the Flask Web Application:

Open a web browser and navigate to:


http://localhost:5000
You should see the homepage of the Flask application.

Stopping the Docker Container:

To stop the running container, you can press CTRL + C in the terminal where the Docker container is running. Alternatively, use the following commands:

bash
Copy code
docker ps  # List running containers to get the container ID
docker stop <container_id>
Removing the Docker Container:

After stopping the container, you can remove it using:

bash
Copy code
docker rm <container_id>
This step is optional but helps to clean up your Docker environment.

Tools and Technologies
This project utilizes the following tools and technologies:

Flask: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python.
Docker: To create, deploy, and run the Flask application inside containers.
Python: The core language used for developing the Flask application.

Creating A Simple Web Application (Python, Flask and Redis Database) Using Docker Compose.


• The application utilizes the Flask Python framework to build a web application
that counts the number of visits to a website.
• Redis database is used for the database tier to keep track of the the counter
